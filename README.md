This project has been developed for the SuperHack 2024

We’re exploring a vision where event ticket distribution and purchasing can be seamlessly managed through web3 ecosystems and solutions. We’ve also mapped out the process for redeeming tickets at the event entrance, with all data securely stored on-chain using EAS attestations. Additionally, we’ve integrated World ID verification to experiment with preventing ticket scalping by ensuring that only verified humans can purchase tickets. Our on-chain smart contract solution also inherently resolves race conditions, preventing the issue of multiple buyers attempting to purchase the same ticket simultaneously.
